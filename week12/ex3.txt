1. DBUF_SIZE flag makes copying process faster. 
   As we may see, copying with bigger buffer sizes 
   makes whole procedure faster and small buffer size 
   decreases the speed.
2. O_SYNC makes it much slower. O_SYNC guarantees that the call 
   will not return before all data has been transferred to the disk
   so that causes delay.
   If we decrease the buffer size than the whole process of copying
   will take significantly more time in comparison with bigger buffer.
