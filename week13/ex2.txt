Deadlock Recovery
Traditional operating system such as Windows doesn’t deal with deadlock recovery 
as it is time and space consuming process. 

    Recovery method
        1. Killing the process.
        2. Resource Preemption

    It is better in cases:
        - In real time operating systems, when security is very important
        - When we need secure process management

Deadlock Prevention may be 
We can prevent Deadlock by eliminating any of the above four condition.
    - Eliminate Mutual Exclusion 
    - Eliminate Hold and wait
    - Eliminate Circular Wait
    - Eliminate No Preemption

    It is better in cases:
        - When we dont care about safety of data 
        - It is strong and efficient for deadlock prevention

Deadlock Avoidance
    - Deadlock avoidance can be done with Banker’s Algorithm.

    Banker’s Algorithm
        - Resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm 
        - Test all the request made by processes for resources
        - If them  no safe state it don’t allow the request made by the process.
