printf() is line buffered, consequently, if it hasn't got \n at
the end of the string, it will not print anything before \n is requested
to be printed or program terminates.

Fork makes a copy of process memory, thus, we will get "Hello" twice because
both, child and parent will have not \n-terminated buffer.

Program 2 has \n thus it will print immediately and then both child and parent
will print \n.
